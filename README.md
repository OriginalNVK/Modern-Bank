## 🧭 <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

Welcome to **ON Modern Bank**, a visually striking and fully responsive banking website built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project represents a key milestone in my learning journey—showcasing not only my ability to design modern UIs but also to structure reusable components for scalability.

The goal was to replicate a sleek, professional online bank layout suitable for portfolio demonstration. Despite initial complexity in file structuring, I gradually adapted to the React ecosystem and learned to handle challenges such as responsive design, component reuse, and directory management.

If you're looking to explore clean front-end architecture with a strong focus on UI/UX, this project is for you.
